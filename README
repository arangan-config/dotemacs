Installation:

On LINUX, MAC or Nixes
=======================
  git clone git://github.com/arangan/dotemacs.git ~/.emacs.d

Create Symlinks:

$ ln -s ~/.emacs.d/emacs ~/.emacs


On Windows
===========
Since the HOME directory is dependent on the HOME env. variable and meddling with this variable can create potential problems with other applications.
So, it is best to specify a HOME variable for emacs.

Create a file called "site-start.el" at the following location (the directory where emacs is installed)
c:\bin\emacs\share\emacs\site-lisp\

Insert this line into this file

(setenv "HOME" "D:/users/{USER}")


cd "D:/users/{USER}"
git clone git://github.com/arangan/dotemacs.git .emacs.d

Open command prompt as Administrator (for Windows 7 and above)
mklink .emacs .emacs.d\emacs


â€¢ Reprogramming the Caps Lock to Control
Run the "emacs-vi.exe" file (made with auto-hotkey) and compiled as an exe.
This will turn Caps Lock to Control only when inside emacs.
Caps Lock to ESC when inside VI

Source of the AutoHotKey
;; use caps lock as control key, when emacs is running.
#IfWinActive ahk_class Emacs
 CapsLock::Ctrl
#IfWinActive 


;; use control key as escape, when vim is running
#IfWinActive ahk_class Vim
 CapsLock::Escape
#IfWinActive
